# Facebook-Dashboard

<h3>Project:</h3>

Dashboard that comparatively monitored trending posts on multiple Facebook pages simultaneously, as well as news stories around the web. Created for a Facebook-focused publication repackaging stories from other outlets to publish on their own genre-branded Facebook pages.

<h3>Applications:</h3>

* [Google Spreadsheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093339)
  * Used for its ability to import data, perform calculations and then display the results through customizable color filters. Cloud-based and sufficient.
* [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
  * Facebook allows users to make API calls through their web-based Graph API Explorer. Access tokens obtained this way are only valid for two hours unless [converted](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/expiration-and-extension) by making a server-side API call, but can be used elsewhere until then.
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
  * TK
* [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
  * TK
  
<h3>Features</h3>

<h3>Libraries:</h3>

*  [Import JSON](https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON)
  * Adds an =ImportJSON() function to the Google spreadsheet (Facebook Graph API outputs data as a JSON). Installed by manually adding ImportJSON.gs through the spreedsheet's Script Editor.
