# Facebook-Dashboard

<h3>Project:</h3>

Dashboard that uses Facebook API to comparatively monitor trending posts on multiple pages simultaneously.

<h3>Applications:</h3>

* [Google Spreadsheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093339)
  * Used for its ability to import data, perform calculations and then display the results through customizable color filters. Cloud-based and sufficient.
* [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
  * Facebook allows users to make API calls through their web-based Graph API Explorer. Access tokens obtained this way are only valid for two hours unless [converted](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/expiration-and-extension) by making a server-side API call, but can be used elsewhere until then.

<h3>Libraries:</h3>
*  [ImportJSON](https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON)

  * Adds an =ImportJSON() function to the spreadsheet (Facebook Graph API outputs data as a JSON). Installed by manually adding ImportJSON.gs through the spreedsheet's Script Editor.

<h3>Workflow:</h3>
